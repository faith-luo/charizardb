Japanese-Chinese cross-linguistic (k|h)an(j|z)i mapping

## Overview

I am a native bilingual English/Chinese speaker. When I started learning Japanese, I found that most language learning resources were targeted either at Chinese speakers or English speakers. There were not a lot of CN/EN/JP resources out there. So I set out to create some on my own. There are enough people in similar situations (Chinese people who have studied English and now want to learn Japanese, Asian-Americans who knows some Chinese studying Japanese) that I figured it might be a helpful resource if I shared it with the public.

Really, the key part of this is that I'd like to be able to see the Japanese variant of a Chinese character (hanzi), and the Chinese variant of a Japanese character (kanji) whenever I look up an English definition.

It's pretty easy to find Japanese-English dictionaries, and Chinese-English dictionaries. You can probably dig out Chinese-Japanese or Japanese-Chinese dictionaries with enough elbow grease and search engine-foo, but they're not easily available to English speakers (which defies needing them in the first place). Also, they tend to have a lot of excess data.
